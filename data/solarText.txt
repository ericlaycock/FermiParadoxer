Your solar system is uninhabitable - your planets are either too far from the sun or too close to support life! Consider either changing your stellar mass, your star's brightness or its class.
Your solar system is uninhabitable - the orbit of your planets varies too much. Sometimes they're in the "Goldilock's Zone", sometimes they fall far outside of it. (Hint - the more planets in a system, the more stable their orbits are.)
Your solar system is habitable! One planet has managed to end up in a stable orbit in the goldilocks zone. Hopefully you'll succeed at your next task...
Your solar system is ideal for supporting life - there are several planets in the goldilocks zone, greatly increasing your chance of one of them evolving life!
Your solar system is uninhabitable - while there are a few planets in the goldilocks zone, the superabundance of planets means every billion years or so there is a cataclysmic disturbance in the orbits of your planets - sending your nascent life-forms out into the cold of space. Try less planets!
