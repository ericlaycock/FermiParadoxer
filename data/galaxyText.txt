Your galaxy is inhospitable. Stars explode as supernovae dangerously close to one another, bombarding any potential planets with life-scouring radiation levels. The high density of stars in your galaxy frequently disturbs the orbits of nascent planets, flinging them out into the inhospitable interstellar void. Try a galaxy that isn't as young, large or full of stars
Your galaxy is inhospitable. Though you go from system to system, you don't find many rocky planets. The average solar system in your galaxy has very low metal content - meaning terrestrial planets are unlikely to form. Try again with a smaller size, more stars, or an older universe.
Your galaxy is hospitable!
Your galaxy is inhospitable - the average solar system has very high levels of metal. This means that in most solar systems, massive gas giants dominate, eating up other smaller planets or de-orbiting them into interstellar space. Try again with a younger universe, a bigger size or less stars.
Your galaxy is inhospitable - while life may have arisen here in the past, any new solar systems forming now will be accretion discs - massive clouds of gas that are the beginning of new solar systems. This means no planets will have formed yet! Try forming a younger galaxy.
